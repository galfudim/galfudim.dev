I'm a software engineer currently working at [Akamai](https://www.akamai.com/), where I focus on designing and implementing features for Akamai’s Guardicore Platform Agent – a Zero Trust (ZT) agent enabling enterprise customers to enforce least-privilege, identity-based access control policies for their apps.

I'm particularly interested in cybersecurity and distributed systems, and I enjoy working on projects that combine both areas. When I'm not learning, you can find me running or checking out new restaurants.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/galfudim) and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/galfudim), or reach out via email if you'd like to connect.
