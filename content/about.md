I'm a software engineer currently working at [Akamai](https://www.akamai.com/), where I build features for Akamai’s Zero Trust (ZT) agent — helping enterprise customers enforce least-privilege, identity-based access policies across their apps.

Beyond cybersecurity, I’m interested in algorithm design and distributed systems. Lately, I’ve been deepening my knowledge of infrastructure tools like Kubernetes, Helm, and Terraform.

When I'm not coding, you'll usually find me...
* running 🏃
* skiing  🎿
* or checking out new restaurants 🍣
